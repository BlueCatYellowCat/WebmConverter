# WebmConverter

The current GUI-based Webm Converters wouldn't work on my computer for an unknown reason, so I made my own simple GUI for ffmpeg webm conversion. It can trim, adjust scaling and bitrate, enable/disable audio and enable/disable VP9.

It works by sending an ffmpeg command to the command line, so ffmpeg must be installed and able to be run via command line.

Python 3 and tkinter must also be installed to run this.

This is presented as is, no warranty, no guarantees, no support, etc.
